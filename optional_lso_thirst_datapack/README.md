# Furmutage + Legendary Survival Overhaul: Thirst Datapack

This optional datapack adds **thirst values** for Furmutage foods and drinks when using [Legendary Survival Overhaul (LSO)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/legendary-survival-overhaul).

**Only enable this datapack if you have LSO installed.**

## Foods included

| Item | Hydration | Quench |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Bottled Orange Juice | 8 | 0.5 |
| Orange Smoothy | 6 | 0.4 |
| Orange Ice Cream | 3 | 0.2 |
| Pealed Oranges, Orange Pie, Orange Muffin, Orange Sweetroll | 2 | 0.1 |
| Orange Foxyas Cookie | 1 | 0.05 |

## How to use

1. **Zip** the `optional_lso_thirst_datapack` folder so the zip contains `pack.mcmeta` and `data/` at the root (no extra parent folder).
2. Put the zip in your world's `datapacks` folder: `saves/<WorldName>/datapacks/`
3. For a new world: put the zip in `datapacks` before creating, or use **Edit** on an existing world and add it.
4. In-game: **Esc → Open LAN** (or edit world) → **Datapacks** → move the pack from "Available" to "Selected".
5. Reload or restart the world.

## For modpack authors

Ship `optional_lso_thirst_datapack.zip` with Furmutage. Players who use LSO can add it to worlds manually.
